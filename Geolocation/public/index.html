      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

    <!-- The defer attribute is a boolean attribute.

    When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the page has finished parsing.

    Note: The defer attribute is only for external scripts (should only be used if the src attribute is present).

    Note: There are several ways an external script can be executed:

    If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while
    the page continues the parsing)
    If async is not present and defer is present: The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
    If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues
    parsing the page -->
