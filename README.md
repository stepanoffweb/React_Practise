# React_Practise
Training tasks on React</br>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In every app directory (in repository's separate  branch), you can run:

### `npm instal`
To install all needed dependences

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
`The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:
  "homepage" : "http://myname.github.io/myapp",
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:
  serve -s build

## WeatherFinder
I've not found a free servise to convert Russian cities names to their coordinates ("geocoding"), so you have to make it manually, sorry.
  geo coords of Kaliningrad:<br>
  54.4312 (54° 43' 27) north latitude<br>
  20.3118 (20° 31' 44) east long<br>
